When I'm creating a new issue on Github I like to use a template - it just helps me order my thoughts.  Here's the one I copy and paste if the repository maintainer has not provided one:

```md
## Describe the issue

## To reproduce

## Expected behaviour

## Screenshots

## Configuration

- OS: 
- Browser:

## Additional context
```

Plenty more examples in Steve Mao's [github-issue-templates](https://github.com/stevemao/github-issue-templates) repo.
