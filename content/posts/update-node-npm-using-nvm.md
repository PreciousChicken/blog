[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is a "POSIX-compliant bash script to manage multiple active node.js versions."  It is a very useful tool for taming Node.js which can throw up some [strange problems](https://stackoverflow.com/q/16151018/6333825) when you install it in the [standard fashion](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

However I only ever use two commands, which I can never remember off the top of my head, so here they are:

## Update Node.js to latest Long Term Support version

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

## Update npm

```bash
nvm install-latest-npm
```

I only realised this was an option recently thanks to a [post by MuffinMan](https://muffinman.io/blog/nvm-updating-npm/).

## Where am I again?

And to confirm which versions you are using:

```bash
node --version && npm --version
```
