## Introduction

Although I've used LaTeX for academic writing before I thought I would give Groff a whirl for something I do from time to time: write formal letters.  Typically these are covering letters or letters of complaint or some such.  A typesetting system such as Groff appeals as the originals are stored in plain text which is memory efficient, useful for text searching within files and scores high for digital preservation (text files being easy to read as opposed to word processing formats).

## The letter

Open a file titled *complaint.me* and copy / paste:

```groff
.in 4i
12 High Street 
.br
Leicester
.br
LS1 1AB
.br
01234 567890

Dear Sir / Madam,
.pp
I am outraged and upset with your response\**
.(f
\** Reference C/A/O123 dated 1st July 2021
.)f
to my recent complaint.  To suggest that 
.i "my chickens"
pecking through 
.i "your broadband wire"
was an event outwith my contract with you is ludicrous.  
Any reputable communications company would ensure that their equipment had been through a testing process which ensures 
.b "fair wear and tear" 
caused by farmyard animals.
.pp
I insist that you release me from the remaining twelve months of my broadband contract immediately, and furthermore compensate me for the distress caused to my poultry.


Yours faithfully,


A N Other
