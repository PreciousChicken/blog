**TL;DR:** I put my AppImages in */opt*.

The AppImages documentation originally (I believe) did not make a reccomendation as to which folder AppImages should be stored in.  The [AppImage FAQ](https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/faq.html#question-where-do-i-store-my-appimages) now however recommends:

> If you donâ€™t want to leave them in $HOME/Downloads, then $HOME/Applications is a good choice.

What's wrong with this?  Well firstly am I actually going to leave them in *Downloads*?  No.  If you are anything like me *Downloads* is full of random dross that is accumulated as you browse the net, kind of like digital lint.  Antyhing worth preserving gets filed
